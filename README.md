# SwiftUI Apps

## Introduction

This repository contains a collection of applications that have been built using Swift and SwiftUI. Typically, there will be two kinds of project in this repository:

1. An existing application that I have attempted to clone only the user interface of. This is to practice building user interfaces from existing apps. These applications are not functional in terms of them performing actions such as adding an alarm. They will only have the user interface built.
2. Applications that are fully functional.

## Applications

### User Interface Only

### Fully Functional
